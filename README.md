# Hephaetron

Welcome to Hephaetron, a collection of handy bioinformatics scripts. This repository is a place for tools and scripts that can help streamline your bioinformatics projects.

## Description

Hephaetron is my collection of resources for tackling those small bioinformatics tasks that seem simple but can end up stealing a lot of your time. Feel free to use it! Each script is crafted with care and is designed to be practical and easy to use, but it may contain bugs as it hasn't been tested extensively. This is my personal toolbox, shared with the world.

## Installation

To get started with Hephaetron, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/m-rossello/Hephaetron.git
```

## Usage

Each script is accompanied by detailed usage instructions and examples. Refer to the README files within individual script directories for specific guidance.
